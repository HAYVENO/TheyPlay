TheyPlay is a community-driven and group-controlled music discovery app designed to help you and your groups - be it family, friends, or colleagues - discover and enjoy music together.

> Note: that TheyPlay is in Development mode, which means that it's a work in progress and some features may not be fully developed yet. Kindly reach out to me [Abdulhafeez Yusuf] to get access to the Beta.

If you're interested in being part of the TheyPlay community and helping me make the app the best it can be, I encourage you to reach out to me. I'll always welcome feedback and suggestions on how to improve the app and make it more user-friendly.

If you have any suggestions, questions or comment concerning this project, you can reach me via my email (haythepen@gmail.com). I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for your interest in TheyPlay. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to make the app an amazing music discovery platform for everyone.
