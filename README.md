# TheyPlay

TheyPlay is a community-driven and group-controlled music discovery app designed to help you and your groups - be it family, friends, or colleagues - discover and enjoy music together.

Please note that TheyPlay is still in alpha, which means that it's a work in progress and some features may not be fully developed yet. However, we're (myself and the contributors) constantly working to improve the app and would love your feedback to help shape its development.

If you're interested in being part of the TheyPlay community and helping me make the app the best it can be, I encourage you to reach out to me. I'm always looking for feedback and suggestions on how to improve the app and make it more user-friendly.

If you have any suggestions, questions or comment concerning this project, you can reach me via my email (haythepen@gmail.com). I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for your interest in TheyPlay. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to make the app an amazing music discovery platform for everyone.
