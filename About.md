# ABOUT THEY-PLAY

I recently started working on a music discovery app called TheyPlay, which allows users to join playgroups and add songs to them. The app is designed to be user-focused, so the playgroups are controlled by unanimous decisions from their members. To keep things manageable, there are daily limits on the number of songs that can be added, and the genres of songs that can be added are determined by group members through consensus.

One of the unique features of TheyPlay is that users can earn points based on the number of likes and adds that their donated songs receive. At the end of every week, there is a weekly MVP for each group, which is calculated using a custom algorithm. Users can also leave comments on the songs they donate to help others understand the emotions they evoke.

From a technical standpoint, I built TheyPlay using a variety of technologies including HTML, Custom CSS, NextJS, React, Serverless functions, Prisma, and PostgresSQL. Overall, I am really proud of this project and the way it combines my interests in music and technology to create a platform that brings people together around shared tastes in music.
